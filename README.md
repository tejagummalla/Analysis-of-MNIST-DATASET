# Analysis-of-MNIST-DATASET

The following project contains the Jupyter Notebooks with the code of the runs for all the classifiers, the name of each of them are in the form ClassifierName-Mninst.ipynb. The Analysis done is by using the MNIST dataset. This dataset contains images for about 70000 hand written digits, each image is a hand written digit for a number between 0-9. The following models tested to classify the MNIST dataset : 
* KNN classifier 
* Kmeans Model, with k = 5,10,20
* Gaussian Mixture Model
* Hierarchical Clustering, cluster size = 10,15
* L2 Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* PCA with Decision Tree classifier and Logistic regression ( Dimensions = 5,10,20,50)
* HARR feature extraction, (features = 200)
* Neural Network, 2 hidden layers (256 nodes, 128 nodes)

The result of all these runs are in the file ANALYSIS-RESULT.doc
